<p>Here you are at the Quick start panel. This page shows you how to get the Dynamic Access Control Demo working right out of the box, with fewest possible steps.</p>

<p><strong>Things you need:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Two android smart phones with API 20 or higher</li>
	<li>BLE Beacon (its MAC ID)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First Step:</strong></p>
<ul type = "circle">
	<li>Install BuildingDepot along with the pre-configured image of BuildingDepot demo database, which holds all the demo buildings and tags, that are essential for this demo to work</li>
	<li>Place a BLE beacon in your Location</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"></p>
<p><strong>Configuring the APK&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the Giotto and Ble_Google_tese APK&rsquo;s from: <a href="https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control">https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control</a></li>
	<li >Open them on Android Studio or Eclipse. Preferably Android Studio</li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>config.java </strong>file</li>
	<li>Edit these fields:</li>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li><strong>ip </strong>&nbsp;- Give the URL on wich you have BuildingDepot installed (Please also specify the PORT of dataservice)</li>
	<li><strong>location&nbsp; - </strong>Enter a location your sensors are in</li>
	<li><strong>userType </strong>&ndash; On one phone, specify as ADMIN and NON-ADMIN on the other phone</li>
	<li><strong>beacon_mac </strong>&ndash; Give your BLE beacon&rsquo;s MAC ID</li>
</ol>

<br><img src="images/config.png"></img><br><br>

	<li value="5">Download both the APK&rsquo;s after the edits into both the phones, with one as ADMIN and the other as NON-ADMIN</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Configuring the Permission Granter:</strong></p>
<p>The Permission granter script is the python script by name "check_locations_OAuth.py". This file can be found in the Github repo : 
<a href="https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control">https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control</a></p>

<p>Download this file onto the server hosting Building Depot. Edit the below field:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>ip</strong> - Give the URL on wich you have BuildingDepot installed (Please also specify the PORT of dataservice)</li>
</ul>

<br><img src="images/granter.png"></img><br><br>

<p><strong>Final Steps:</strong></p>
<p>Do this only after you have completed all the above steps !!!</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run the newly configured "check_locations_OAuth.py"</li>
	<li>Using the GIOTTO app: </li>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Open the App on both the ADMIN and NON-ADMIN phones</li>
		<li>Test case:</li>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Login on the NON-ADMIN phone. Select Location "Google" from the dropdown menu. It shows "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
				<li>Now, Login over the ADMIN phone and select Location "Google". The ADMIN would be able to view a list of sensors in this Location</li>
				<li>Once admin has selected Location "Google", refresh the NON-ADMIN's GIOTTO app with the refresh button on the top right corner of screen. The page gets updated with a list of sensors that the ADMIN can view</li>
				<li>Select Location "Random" on ADMIN's phone and refresh the NON-ADMIN's phone. The list disappears and shows "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
	<br>
	<li>Using the BLE_GOOGLE_TESE app:</li>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Open the App on both the ADMIN and NON-ADMIN phones</li>
		<li>Test case:</li>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>When ADMIN is not near the beacon's range, the list on NON-ADMIN's app shows "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
				<li>Now, bring the ADMIN closer to the beacon. ADMIN will be able to view the sensors in his location</li>
				<li>Refresh the NON-ADMIN's app with the refresh button on the top right corner of the page and would be able to view the list of sensors in that beacon Location</li>
				<li>Remove the ADMIN away from the beacon and again refresh the NON-ADMIN's app. This time, it returns "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
