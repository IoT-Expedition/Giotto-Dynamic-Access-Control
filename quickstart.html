<p><u><strong>Things you need:</strong></u></p>

<ol>
	<li>Two android smart phones with API 20 or higher</li>
	<li>A BLE Beacon</li>
</ol>

<p><u><strong>First Step:</strong></u></p>
<ul type = "circle">
	<li>Install BuildingDepot along with the pre-configured image of BuildingDepot demo database, which holds all the demo buildings and tags, that are essential for this demo to work</li>
	<li>Place a BLE beacon in your sensor deployed Location</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Configuring the Permission Granter:</strong></u></p>
<p>The Permission granter script is the python script by name "check_locations_OAuth.py". This file can be found in the Github repo : 
<a href="https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control">https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/Giotto-Dynamic-Access-Control</a></p>

<p>Download this file onto the server hosting Building Depot. Edit the below field:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>ip</strong> - Give the URL on wich you have BuildingDepot installed (Please also specify the PORT of dataservice)</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Final Steps:</strong></u></p>
<p>Do this only after you have completed all the above steps !!!</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run the newly configured "check_locations_OAuth.py" in the terminal</li><br>
	<li>Using the GIOTTO app: </li>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Install and open the application on both the phones</li><br>
		<li>On one phone, enter the user name as <strong>admin@admin.com</strong>. Leave the password field unchanged. Click <strong>Settings</strong> button. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>BD URL -  </strong> Enter the URL on which you have installed Building Depot</li>
				<li> <strong>BD PORT - </strong> Enter the PORT of the BuildingDepot's Dataservice. Default is <strong>82</strong></li>
				<li><strong>OAuth Client Credentials</strong> obtain the credentials from the Web UI of Building Depot. Use the login credentials <strong>username : admin@admin.com </strong> and <strong>password : admin</strong></li><br>
			</ul>
		<li>On the other phone, enter the user name as <strong>non-admin@non-admin.com</strong>. Leave the password field unchanged. Click <strong>Settings</strong> button. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>BD URL -  </strong> Enter the URL on which you have installed Building Depot</li>
				<li> <strong>BD PORT - </strong> Enter the PORT of the BuildingDepot's Dataservice. Default is <strong>82</strong></li>
				<li><strong>OAuth Client Credentials - </strong> obtain the credentials from the Web UI of Building Depot. Use the login credentials <strong>username : non-admin@non-admin.com </strong> and <strong>password : non-admin</strong></li><br>
			</ul>
		<li>Test case:</li>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Login on the NON-ADMIN phone. Select Location "Google" from the dropdown menu. It displays "Not Authenticated to view this List", since ADMIN is not in Location "Google"</li>
				<li>Now, Login on the ADMIN phone and select Location "Google". The ADMIN would be able to view a list of sensors in this Location</li>
				<li>Once admin has selected Location "Google", refresh the NON-ADMIN's GIOTTO app with the refresh button on the top right corner of screen. The page gets updated with a list of sensors that the ADMIN has granted access for the NON-ADMIN to view.</li>
				<li>Select Location "Random" on ADMIN's phone and refresh the NON-ADMIN's phone. The list disappears and shows "Not Authenticated to view this List", since ADMIN is no longer in that location</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
	<br>


	<li>Using the BLE_GOOGLE_TESE app:</li>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Install and open the application on both the phones</li><br>
		<li>On one phone, enter the user name as <strong>admin@admin.com</strong>. Leave the password field unchanged. Click <strong>Settings</strong> button. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>BD URL -  </strong> Enter the URL on which you have installed Building Depot</li>
				<li> <strong>BD PORT - </strong> Enter the PORT of the BuildingDepot's Dataservice. Default is <strong>82</strong></li>
				<li><strong>OAuth Client Credentials - </strong> obtain the credentials from the Web UI of Building Depot. Use the login credentials <strong>username : admin@admin.com </strong> and <strong>password : admin</strong></li>
				<li><strong>BEACON MAC - </strong> Enter the MAC ID of your Beacon</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li>On the other phone, enter the user name as <strong>non-admin@non-admin.com</strong>. Leave the password field unchanged. Click <strong>Settings</strong> button. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>BD URL -  </strong> Enter the URL on which you have installed Building Depot</li>
				<li> <strong>BD PORT - </strong> Enter the PORT of the BuildingDepot's Dataservice. Default is <strong>82</strong></li>
				<li><strong>OAuth Client Credentials</strong> obtain the credentials from the Web UI of Building Depot. Use the login credentials <strong>username : non-admin@non-admin.com </strong> and <strong>password : non-admin</strong></li>
				<li><strong>BEACON MAC - </strong> Enter the MAC ID of your Beacon</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li>Test case:</li>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>When ADMIN is not near the beacon's range, the list on NON-ADMIN's app shows "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
				<li>Now, bring the ADMIN closer to the beacon. ADMIN will be able to view the sensors in his location</li>
				<li>Refresh the NON-ADMIN's app with the refresh button on the top right corner of the page and would be able to view the list of sensors in that beacon Location</li>
				<li>Remove the ADMIN away from the beacon and again refresh the NON-ADMIN's app. This time, it returns "Not Authenticated to view this List"</li>
