<h2><u>Giotto Application Documentaion</u></h2>

<p>The working of the GIOTTO apk is explained in this documentation. The working is explained in steps as below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>All the necessary information like OAuth keys, user type's and email's are supplied through the config file. Also, each HTTP/HTTPS request to the BuildingDepot Server requires an OAuth Authorization header. Hence we generate an access_token using the OAuth client credentials supplied. We generate access_tokens in the <b>config.java</b> file, in the <b>getToken()</b> function</li><br>

	<li>The <b>MainActivity</b> activity does the basic credential check. In BuildingDepot, the Location Sensor holds the user's credentials as <b>METADATA</b>. From the app, th credentials suppplied in the config file are verified with the metadata of user Location Sensor. The user could be Admin/ Non-Admin. Once authorized, it moves to the next page.</li><br>

	<li>In the <b>Devices</b> Activity,the Location Dropdown is populated with the location provided </li>
</ol>
